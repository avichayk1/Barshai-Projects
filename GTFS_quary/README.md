# Project README

This project contains two GTFS query Python scripts, each designed to handle and process data in different ways. Below are the details for each script.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `getTrip.py`

#### Purpose:
This script fetches and processes trip-related data from a given GTFS data source. It extracts relevant details about trips and prepares them for further analysis or reporting.

#### Features:
- Extracts trip data from a data source (e.g., database, API).
- Processes trip-related information, such as duration, stations, or other parameters.
- Customizable to adapt to various data sources and formats.

#### Usage:
1. Ensure the required dependencies are installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python getTrip.py
## Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Dependencies:
- `requests`: For handling HTTP requests.
- `pandas`: For data processing and manipulation.

To install the dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
### 2. `JoinForGetTheMaxAmountOfOperatorPerStation.py`

#### Purpose:
This script joins datasets containing information about stations and operators. It calculates the maximum number of operators assigned to each station.

#### Features:
- Joins data from different sources (e.g., station data, operator data).
- Computes the maximum number of operators for each station.
- Outputs the results in a format suitable for further analysis or reporting.

#### Usage:
1. Ensure that the required datasets are available and correctly formatted.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python JoinForGetTheMaxAmountOfOperatorPerStation.py
## Requirements:

- Python 3.x

### Dependencies:
- `pandas`: For data handling and manipulation.
- `numpy`: If needed for computations.

### Other Libraries (if any):
- List any additional libraries required for the script here.

### Installation:
To get started, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You may also need to install the required libraries for both scripts. You can do so by creating a `requirements.txt` file (if not already provided) or by installing libraries manually using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
